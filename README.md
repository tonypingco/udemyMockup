## About SCSS Coding

Hi, it's me, Tony Nguyen.

I have created a project to mock up Udemy landing page, to practice my SCSS skill that I learned during the Cyberlearn course. It's more convenient than css and assisted me in organising my codes. My site can be reached at: [**Udemy Mockup**](https://tonysn.com/portfolio/udemyMockup/udemy.html)

Udemy landing page would be one of the most challenging project that I have ever done, but it's modern site and up-to-date functions for an online learning website and good for my practicing.

Please feel free to use my codes as your preference, or you can inspect Udemy site, the original source that I am following.

Peace,

Tony Nguyen
